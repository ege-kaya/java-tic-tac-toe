# Java Tic-Tac-Toe

A Java program for a 4x4 tic-tac-toe game played against the computer, with a save/load game functionality included.

This was originally implemented for an introduction to programming class, where using object oriented programming concepts was disallowed. Hence the bloated and non-modular code.
